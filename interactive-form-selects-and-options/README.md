## Selects and Options

### Intro

Select and option elements are commonly found on web forms, but can be confusing to work with.  You'll encounter these elements in the Interactive Form project.  Here’s some lightweight practice interacting with and manipulating select and option elements.  You’ll use JavaScript to log the values of select and option elements to the console, and program a select element to update a simple UI.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, selecting a new shirt from the select element will update the page and print values to the console.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out to your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
