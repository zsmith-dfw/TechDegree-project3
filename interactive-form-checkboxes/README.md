# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree - Project Warm Up

## Checkboxes

### Intro

We find forms all over the web.  So you can probably imagine that working with forms can be a big part of a developer's job.  The third project in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree is all about forms.  And one of the trickier parts of the project is the section that involves checkboxes.  Here’s some lightweight practice with checkboxes.  You’ll use JavaScript to listen for changes on a collection of checkboxes.  And then you'll disable/enable conflicting checkboxes to ensure users can't choose more items than are allowed.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, the user will be prevented from selecting more than one super power and one super suit color combo.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out to your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
