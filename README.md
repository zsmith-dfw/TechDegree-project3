# TechDegree project3
Interactive Form

This is my third project in the Techdegree for FSJS web development. Written in vanilla Javascript, this program utilizes DOM selection, manipulation, creation, and validation through conditional expressions to allow a user to register for a Web Development Conference. After giving basic contact information, users will select desired t shirt, activities, and method of payment. Validation prevents users from accidentally selecting conflicting activities, or t shirt combinations that don't exist. 

 This program is designed for modularity and can be tailored to a users needs. The base CSS and html documents offer lots of customization. This form can be made into a registration form for any event, job application, purchase, etc.

 A future release of this program will implement real time validation to make users aware of any mistaes instantly.

 I would like to credit the following members of the Treehouse slack community for their motivation and guidance. This project would not be possible without their assistance: Scott Adams, Kalen Honeyfield, Lee Vaughn, Megan K. O'Brien, and Aidan Kim.
